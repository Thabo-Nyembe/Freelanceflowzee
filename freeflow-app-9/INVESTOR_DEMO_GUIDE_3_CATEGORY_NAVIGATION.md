## Handling Investor Questions

### Q: "Why 3 categories instead of more specific groupings?"

**A:** "We studied how creative professionals think about their work. They separate AI/intelligence from creative production from business management. Three categories match their mental model - it's intuitive, not arbitrary. Plus, during demos, investors can grasp our full value proposition in under 30 seconds."

### Q: "How does this compare to competitors?"

**A:** "Adobe has 20+ separate apps - users need to learn each one. Notion has one big database - everything feels the same. We found the sweet spot: 3 clear categories, each with purpose-built tools, all integrated. It's organized complexity."

### Q: "Can users customize the navigation?"

**A:** "In our roadmap, yes. Phase 2 includes favorites, recent items, and role-based views. But our research shows the 3-category structure works for 90% of users. We'll enhance, not replace it."

### Q: "What about mobile?"

**A:** "Business Operations → Mobile App and Desktop App are in the navigation. Same 3-category structure will work across platforms. We're designing platform-agnostic from day one."

### Q: "How do you decide what goes in each category?"

**A:** "Simple rule: If it generates insights or uses AI → AI & Intelligence. If it creates or edits content → Creative Studio. If it manages business processes → Business Operations. Every feature has a clear home."
