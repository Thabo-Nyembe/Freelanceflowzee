For DataFlow, consider these concepts:\n\n1. **Flow Symbol**: Use flowing lines or curves to represent data movement\n2. **Data Visualization**: Incorporate charts, graphs, or data points\n3. **Abstract \"D\"**: Create a geometric \"D\" with flow elements\n4. **Network Node**: Show interconnected dots representing data connections\n\nWhat industry or style preferences does the client have?",
