## 🎯 Testing Strategy Overview

### Core Testing Principles (Based on Context7 Best Practices)

1. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert structure for all tests
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Test names explain scenario and expectation
3. **Isolated Tests**: Each test creates its own data, no global fixtures
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
5. **Real Component Testing**: Use actual components, not artificial structures

## 🎯 Test Case Templates

### Template 1: Feature Functionality Test
```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('Scenario Context', () => {
    it('When [specific condition], then [expected outcome]', async () => {
      // Arrange - Set up test data and environment
      await setupTestEnvironment();
      const testData = createTestData();

      // Act - Execute the functionality
      const result = await executeFeature(testData);

      // Assert - Verify expected outcomes
      expect(result.status).toBe('expected_status');
      expect(result.data).toMatchObject(expectedData);
    });
  });
});
```

### Template 2: Error Handling Test
```typescript
describe('Feature Name Error Handling', () => {
  it('When [error condition occurs], then [proper error response]', async () => {
    // Arrange - Set up error condition
    const invalidData = createInvalidTestData();

    // Act & Assert - Expect specific error
    await expect(executeFeature(invalidData))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('Expected error message');
  });
});
```

### Template 3: Integration Test
