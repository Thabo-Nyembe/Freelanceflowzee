## 📝 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from Monday.com + QuickBooks?**
A: Those are point solutions. KAZI is built AI-first with all features sharing one database. You can't get AI insights across your CRM, projects, and finances with separate tools.

**Q: What's your go-to-market strategy?**
A: Three-pronged:
1. Content marketing targeting freelancers/agencies
2. Partnership with creative communities (Behance, Dribbble)
3. Freemium model with viral features

**Q: Why will you win against established players?**
A: They're legacy systems with technical debt. We're AI-native, modern tech stack, 10x better UX, and 50% cheaper. We can move faster and innovate faster.

**Q: What's your biggest risk?**
A: Customer acquisition cost. We're mitigating with strong organic content strategy and viral features. Our LTV:CAC of 12:1 gives us room to optimize.

**Q: When will you be profitable?**
A: Month 18-24 with $500K MRR and 5,000 customers. We're optimizing for growth, not profitability in year 1.

**Q: How big is your team?**
A: Currently solo founder (technical). Raising seed to hire:
- 3 engineers (full-stack, AI, mobile)
- 2 growth marketers
- 1 customer success lead
- 1 designer

**Q: What's your revenue model?**
A: SaaS subscription:
- Starter: $49/month
- Professional: $99/month
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
Plus add-ons for premium AI features
