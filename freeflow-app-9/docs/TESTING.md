# Video Platform Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the FreeFlow video platform. Our testing approach includes end-to-end (E2E) tests, integration tests, and unit tests to ensure comprehensive coverage of all video functionality.

## Test Structure

### E2E Tests
Located in `/tests/e2e/`, these tests cover complete user flows:

1. **Video Upload (`video-upload.spec.ts`)**
   - File upload process
   - Upload error handling
   - Metadata validation
   - Drag and drop functionality

2. **Video Playback (`video-playback.spec.ts`)**
   - Basic playback controls
   - Mobile playback support
   - Offline mode handling
   - Analytics tracking

3. **Bulk Operations (`bulk-operations.spec.ts`)**
   - Multiple video selection
   - Batch delete/move/tag operations
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling

4. **Video Search (`video-search.spec.ts`)**
   - Title and transcript search
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Mobile search interface
   - Empty state handling

### Integration Tests
Located in `/tests/integration/`:
- API endpoint testing
- Database operations
- Third-party service integration

### Unit Tests
Located in `/tests/__tests__/`:
- Component rendering
- Hook functionality
- Utility functions
- State management

## Test Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event msw
```

### Configuration Files
1. `playwright.config.ts` - E2E test configuration
2. `vitest.config.ts` - Unit test configuration
3. `tests/setup.ts` - Test environment setup

## Running Tests

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/video-upload.spec.ts

# Run in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Videos
- Located in `/tests/fixtures/`
- Sample video files for upload testing
- Mock video metadata

### Mock Services
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
- Mock Supabase client for database operations
- Mock MUX service for video processing

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests using `describe` blocks
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

2. **Data Management**
   - Clean up test data after each test
   - Use unique identifiers for test data
   - Avoid test interdependencies

3. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test responsive layouts
   - Verify touch interactions
   - Check mobile-specific features

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor test execution time
   - Test under different network conditions
   - Verify resource loading

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Coverage Goals**
   - Achieve 80%+ code coverage
   - Add visual regression tests
   - Implement accessibility testing

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add load testing for video operations
   - Implement streaming performance tests
   - Add CDN integration tests

3. **Security Testing**
   - Add penetration testing
   - Implement security scanning
   - Add DRM testing

4. **Automation**
   - Automate test data generation
   - Add visual test review process
   - Implement test result analytics
