### LinkedIn Post

```
Excited to announce the launch of KAZI - the platform I wish existed when I started freelancing.

The Problem:
Creative professionals are drowning in subscriptions. CRM here, invoicing there, video editing somewhere else, messaging in another tab. 10+ tools, $100+/month, and constant context switching.

The Solution:
KAZI combines everything:
- Professional video studio (4K editing, AI transcription)
- Project management with Kanban, lists, calendars
- Invoicing with ESCROW payments (unique in the industry)
- Client portal for transparency
- 12+ AI models for content, design, and business intelligence
- Real-time collaboration with live cursors

All for $49-99/month.

We're not trying to replace one tool - we're eliminating tool fatigue entirely.

Launch offer: 40% off your first year for the first 1,000 users.

If you're a freelancer, agency owner, or creative professional tired of juggling subscriptions, I'd love for you to try KAZI.

### Maker Comment
```
Hey everyone!

I'm [Name], founder of KAZI.

Quick backstory: I was spending $100+/month on HoneyBook, Loom, Adobe tools, Slack, Canva, and Notion. The constant switching between apps was killing my productivity.

So I built what I wished existed - one platform that does it all.

Some things I'm especially proud of:
1. Our escrow system - no other freelancer platform has this
2. 12+ AI models - you're not locked into one provider
3. The video studio - it's actually professional, not just trimming
4. Universal Pinpoint Feedback - annotate anything, anywhere

I'm here all day to answer questions. Fire away!

And thanks for the support - it means everything.
