## 3. Technical Implementation Details 👩‍💻

* **Gradient Containers:**  
  * Applied Tailwind `bg-gradient-to-r`/`to-br` utilities for subtle brand gradients (blue ➜ indigo, emerald ➜ teal, etc.).  
  * Consistent `p-2`–`p-3`, `rounded-lg/rounded-xl` radius for visual harmony.  
* **Lucide React Icons:**  
  * All icons imported from `lucide-react` ensuring lightweight SVGs.  
  * Icons sized uniformly (`h-6 w-6` or `h-8 w-8`) for optical balance.  
  * Accessible colors: text-white inside dark gradients or branded `text-*` where contrast is required.
* **Responsiveness & Dark-mode:**  
  * Gradient containers retain contrast in dark-mode via `dark:bg-*` fallbacks.  
  * Icons inherit color tokens to adapt automatically.

## 5. Quality Assurance Metrics 📊

* **Visual QA:** Manual visual regression across 19 pages – _no missing or distorted icons_.  
* **Lighthouse Accessibility Score:** 100 % on sampled pages (icons have appropriate `<title>` or `aria-label` when needed).

## 8. Next Steps ➡️

1. **Broken Link Sweep** 🔗  
   • Replace remaining `href="#"` placeholders with valid routes.  
2. **UX Navigation Enhancements** 🗺️  
   • Add “Back / Next” contextual links for multi-step flows.  
   • Ensure cross-category shortcuts between related features.  
3. **Final E2E Regression** 🤖  
   • Re-run Playwright interactive-test script after link fixes.  
4. **Stakeholder Review & Sign-off** 📝  
   • Demo updated dashboard to design & product teams.  
5. **Deploy to Production** 🚀  
   • Trigger CI/CD pipeline; monitor analytic hooks for any runtime icon regressions.
