## SESSION LOG

### Week 1: Tier 1 Core Features (Target: 3-5 features)

#### Session 55: Dashboard Overview
- **Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Duration**: 2.5 hours
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Tables Used**: `projects`, `clients`, `invoices`, `tasks`, `files`, `team_members`
- **Work Completed**:
  - Created `lib/dashboard-stats.ts` with 6 real Supabase query functions
  - Replaced mock API call with real database queries (Promise.all for parallel fetching)
  - Wired all 4 stat cards to dashboardStats state (earnings, projects, clients, hours)
  - Added dynamic revenue growth % calculation from real data
  - Integrated logger tracking and toast notifications with real metrics
  - Git commits: 2 commits (data fetching + UI binding)
- **Challenges**:
  - Dashboard page is 2,142 lines (large file to refactor)
  - Mock data scattered throughout - needed systematic replacement
- **Learnings**:
  - Dynamic imports optimize bundle size for utility functions
  - Promise.all significantly improves dashboard load time
  - Structured logger context helps debug Supabase queries
- **Next Steps**: Projects Hub refactoring (6-8 hours estimated)

#### Session 56: Projects Hub
- **Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Duration**: 4.5 hours
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Tables Used**: `dashboard_projects`, `team_project_members`
- **Work Completed**:
  - Created `lib/projects-hub-queries.ts` with 15 Supabase query functions (500+ lines)
  - Replaced mockProjects with real database queries
  - Implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Wired create project handler to createProject()
  - Wired status updates to updateProjectStatus()
  - Added data transformation (database format ↔ UI format)
  - Integrated structured logging and toast notifications
  - Git commits: 1 major commit (Projects Hub integration)
- **Challenges**:
  - Status mapping between UI ('active', 'completed') and DB ('In Progress', 'Completed')
  - Data transformation for complex project objects
  - Finding correct table name (dashboard_projects not projects)
- **Learnings**:
  - Dynamic imports work great for large utility files
  - Status enum mapping requires careful transformation
  - TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across transformations
- **Next Steps**: Clients Management refactoring (6-8 hours estimated)

#### Session 58: Clients Management
- **Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Duration**: 5.0 hours
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Tables Used**: `clients` (minimal schema applied via Supabase SQL Editor)
- **Work Completed**:
  - Applied minimal clients table migration to Supabase (11 lines, TEXT status column)
  - Created `lib/clients-queries.ts` with 17 Supabase query functions (500+ lines)
  - Replaced mockClients with real database queries in page.tsx (1,811 lines)
  - Implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search)
  - Wired create client handler to createClient()
  - Added data transformation (database format ↔ UI format)
  - Integrated structured logging and toast notifications with real metrics
  - Git commits: 1 major commit (Clients Management integration)
- **Challenges**:
  - Initial full CHUNK_05 migration failed: "column status does not exist"
  - Clipboard copy issue when trying to paste migration SQL
  - Large page file (1,811 lines) required careful systematic refactoring
- **Learnings**:
  - Minimal schemas work better than complex migrations with dependencies
  - TEXT columns more flexible than ENUMs for initial setup
  - User collaboration on DB migrations ensures successful application
  - Data transformation layer critical for bridging DB ↔ UI differences
- **Next Steps**: Video Studio refactoring (8-10 hours estimated)

#### Session 59: Video Studio
- **Date**: November 27, 2025
- **Duration**: 6.5 hours
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Tables Used**: `video_projects` (minimal schema with ENUMs)
- **Work Completed**:
  - Applied minimal video_projects migration (ENUMs + table + indexes)
  - Created `lib/video-studio-queries.ts` with 17 Supabase functions (585 lines)
  - Replaced mock data loading with real database queries in page.tsx (2,357 lines)
  - Implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search, Duplicate)
  - Wired create handler to createVideoProject()
  - Added data transformation (database format ↔ UI format)
  - Integrated structured logging and toast notifications
  - Git commits: 1 major commit (Video Studio integration)
- **Challenges**:
  - Initial ENUM syntax error: "CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS" not supported
  - Fixed with DROP TYPE IF EXISTS CASCADE + CREATE TYPE pattern
  - Large page file (2,357 lines) required systematic approach
  - Video status mapping between DB and UI formats
- **Learnings**:
  - PostgreSQL doesn't support IF NOT EXISTS for CREATE TYPE
  - DROP CASCADE + CREATE pattern works reliably for ENUMs
  - Video project management needs analytics (views, likes tracking)
  - Data transformation layer essential for complex UI/DB mapping
  - Dynamic imports continue to optimize bundle size effectively
- **Next Steps**: Files Hub refactoring (6-8 hours estimated)
