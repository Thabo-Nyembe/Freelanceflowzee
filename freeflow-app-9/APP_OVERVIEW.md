## High-Level Architecture

FreeFlow is a modern, full-stack web application built on the Next.js framework. It utilizes Supabase for its backend-as-a-service (BaaS), including database, authentication, and storage. The architecture is designed to be server-centric, with a strong emphasis on server components for data fetching and rendering, while using client components for interactivity.

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage), Next.js API Routes
- **Key Libraries:** React Query (data fetching), Framer Motion (animations), Lucide (icons)

## Core Features

### Authentication

Authentication is managed through Supabase Auth, providing a secure and scalable solution for user management. The flow is as follows:

- **Sign-up/Login:** Users can sign up and log in via social providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) or with an email and password. The application uses a redirect-based flow, where users are sent to a Supabase-hosted UI and then redirected back to the app upon successful authentication.
- **Session Management:** User sessions are managed using secure tokens stored in `localStorage`. The `UserButton` component and other parts of the application access this data to display user-specific information and control access to protected routes.
- **Logout:** A manual logout process clears all authentication-related data from `localStorage`, effectively ending the user's session.

### Dashboard

The main dashboard serves as the central hub for users, providing a high-level overview of their activities and a primary navigation point to all key features.

- **At-a-Glance Metrics:** The dashboard prominently displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total earnings, the number of active projects, and pending payments.
- **Tab-Based Navigation:** The core of the dashboard is a dynamic, tab-based interface that allows users to seamlessly switch between different functional areas of the application, including:
  - **Projects Hub:** For managing all creative projects.
  - **AI Create:** For accessing AI-powered content generation tools.
  - **Video Studio:** For professional video creation and editing.
  - **And many more...** (Files, Community, etc.)
- **Global Search:** A persistent search bar allows users to quickly find projects, files, or other resources from anywhere in the dashboard.
- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.

### AI-Powered Studio

The AI Create Studio is a versatile content generation tool that integrates multiple leading AI models to assist with creative tasks.

- **Multi-Model Support:** Users can seamlessly switch between different AI providers, including Google AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter, choosing the best model for their specific needs.
- **Prompt-Based Generation:** The studio provides a simple, intuitive interface where users can input a text prompt and receive generated content.
- **Extensible Design:** While currently focused on text generation, the studio is built to be extensible for other modalities like image or code generation in the future.

### Real-Time Collaboration

The platform includes a powerful real-time collaboration suite, enabling multiple users to work together on documents and projects simultaneously. The key features include:

- **Status & Priority Tracking:** The system allows for clear tracking of each project's status (e.g., Draft, Active, Completed) and priority, ensuring that teams can focus on what matters most.

### Analytics Dashboard

The platform features a comprehensive, real-time analytics dashboard to monitor application performance and user behavior in detail.

- **Real-Time Metrics:** The dashboard fetches and displays a wide range of metrics, including user counts, session times, revenue, and top pages, with an auto-refresh capability to ensure data is always current.
