## ❓ INVESTOR Q&A CHEAT SHEET

### Q: "How does this compare to HoneyBook/Dubsado?"
**A:** "We don't compete - we replace the entire tool stack. They're point solutions. KAZI is comprehensive: CRM + Projects + Finance + AI + Creative tools. Plus we're 50% cheaper and AI-native."

### Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"
**A:** "Three channels: (1) Content marketing - freelancer blogs and tutorials, (2) Community partnerships - creative professional groups, (3) Freemium viral features. Blended CAC: $150 with $1,800 LTV."

### Q: "How do you prevent churn?"
**A:** "High switching costs through data network effects. Once users have clients, projects, and history in KAZI, leaving means recreating everything. Plus AI gets smarter with their data over time."

### Q: "What if OpenAI or Notion builds this?"
**A:** "They could, but won't. OpenAI doesn't do vertical SaaS. Notion is horizontal collaboration. We're laser-focused on creative professionals - deep domain expertise they can't match quickly. Plus we have a 12-18 month head start."

### Q: "How will you use the $2-3M?"
**A:** "40% Engineering (1 → 8 team members), 40% Sales & Marketing (0 → 1,000 customers), 20% Operations. 24-30 month runway to $150K MRR and Series A readiness."

### Q: "When will you be profitable?"
**A:** "Month 18-24 at $500K MRR with 5,000 customers. 75% gross margins mean we can be profitable at scale while still investing in growth."
