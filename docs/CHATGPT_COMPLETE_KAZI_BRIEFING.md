### Video 1: Product Overview (3 minutes)

**Script:**

"Hi, I'm [Name], founder of KAZI.

I used to be a freelance designer. And like most freelancers, I used a ton of tools.

Adobe for creative work. Monday.com for projects. QuickBooks for invoicing. Zoom for calls. Dropbox for files. ChatGPT for AI. And probably 5 more I'm forgetting.

My monthly software bill? $200.

My morning routine? Logging into 10 different apps.

My data? Scattered everywhere.

So we built KAZI. The only platform freelancers need.

[Show quick montage of features]

Creative suite? Check. Professional video, audio, 3D modeling.

Project management? Check. Kanban boards, time tracking, workflows.

AI tools? Check. 8 AI features including content generation and voice synthesis.

Financial management? Check. Invoicing, escrow, expense tracking.

Team collaboration? Check. Video calls, real-time editing, messaging.

And it's all connected. Your projects link to your time tracking. Your time tracking links to your invoices. Your files link to your projects. Everything just works together.

Price? $79/month. That's less than Adobe alone.

Try it free for 14 days. No credit card. No catch.
