# KAZI AI Enhancement Strategy  
*Version 1.0 • Prepared for the Executive Steering Committee*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

KAZI’s existing AI capabilities delight users but rely on mock data and siloed integrations. By executing the 5-phase program described here we will:

* Deliver real-time, production-grade AI processing across video, text, image, and audio.
* Unlock a projected **$4.3 M incremental annual value** through productivity gains, premium upsells, and churn reduction.
* Increase feature adoption by **>40 %**, boost content-creation velocity by **3×**, and raise NPS by **+6 points**.

## 2. Current State Analysis

| Area | Component | Status | Gaps |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| Video | `ai-video-recording-system.tsx` | UI complete, AI processing mocked | No live transcription service, no speaker diarisation, analytics simulated |
| Collaboration | `enterprise-video-studio.tsx` | MVP ready | Missing real-time co-editing, live cursor AI, quality auto-tuning |
| Content Gen | `ai-create-studio.tsx` | Text/image/code generation via OpenAI & Anthropic | No caching, no rate governance, no brand-tone guardrails |
| Insights | `ai-insights-dashboard.tsx` | Static charts | Absent predictive analytics, no semantic search |
| Chat | `enhanced-ai-chat.tsx` | Solid UX | Needs streaming responses & function-calling support |

---

## 3. 5-Phase Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1 – Real-time AI Processing Infrastructure
* Stand-up managed inference layer (OpenAI v1 & Anthropic v3) behind a single GraphQL/REST gateway.  
* WebSocket streaming for transcripts & chat.  
* Caching (Redis, 30 min TTL) + exponential back-off & circuit breakers.  
* **Deliverables:** Unified AI gateway repo, infra-as-code (Terraform), observability dashboards.

### Phase 2 – Advanced Video Intelligence
* Integrate AssemblyAI / Deepgram for live transcription & speaker labels (<3 s latency).  
* Add video scene-change detection, emotion & sentiment scoring (AWS Rekognition).  
* Auto-generate chapters, summaries, and keyword tags stored in `ai_analysis` table.  
* **Deliverables:** New `/video/intelligence` micro-service, Supabase functions, Playwright a11y tests.

### Phase 3 – Multi-modal AI Integration
* Add image generation (DALL·E 3 / Stable Diffusion XL) & audio synthesis (ElevenLabs).  
* Single prompt UX in **AI Create Studio** with content-type routing.  
* Cross-modal embeddings stored in pgvector for semantic search.  
* **Deliverables:** Updated studio UI, `ai_media` table schema, vector-search API.

### Phase 4 – Smart Collaboration Features
* AI-generated task suggestions & action items in project timelines.  
* Real-time language translation & subtitle overlay in live sessions.  
* Intelligent highlight reels (top moments) shared to teams automatically.  
* **Deliverables:** Collaboration SDK v2, event-driven Lambda for highlight pipeline, UX enhancements.

### Phase 5 – Predictive Analytics & Optimization
* Cohort-level churn prediction & upsell recommendations.  
* Usage anomaly detection (Sentry + custom ML) → auto-throttle or scale.  
* Continuous fine-tuning loop on anonymised transcripts to improve accuracy by 15 %.  
* **Deliverables:** ML pipeline (feature store, training jobs), Looker dashboards, quarterly model report.

## 4. Technical Architecture Improvements

* **Unified AI Gateway** → Rate-limited, auth-aware proxy exposing `/ai/*` endpoints.  
* **Event Bus (NATS)** → Streams transcription segments, analytics events, model outputs.  
* **Vector DB (pgvector + Supabase)** → Stores embeddings for search & recommendation.  
* **Edge Functions (Vercel Edge / Cloudflare Workers)** → Low-latency inference for type-ahead & chat.  
* **Observability Stack** → OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Sentry, Prometheus alerts (<2 min MTTR goal).

## 5. Performance Metrics & Success Criteria

| KPI | Baseline | Target |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Transcript latency | 15 s | **< 3 s** |
| Transcription accuracy | 83 % | **≥ 92 %** |
| AI chat response time | 6.5 s | **≤ 2 s (P95)** |
| Feature adoption (AI Create) | 22 % | **> 40 %** |
| Revenue / MAU | \$12.4 | **\$17.0** |
| NPS | 47 | **> 53** |

## 6. Timeline & Resource Requirements

| Phase | Duration | Core Roles | Key Dependencies |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | 4 weeks | AI Infra Eng ×2, DevOps Eng, PM | Provider APIs, Vercel Edge |
| 2 | 5 weeks | ML Eng, Frontend Eng ×2, QA | AssemblyAI contract |
| 3 | 4 weeks | Full-stack Eng ×2, UX Designer | GPU budget, pgvector ext. |
| 4 | 6 weeks | Collaboration Eng ×2, ML Eng, PM | Translation APIs |
| 5 | 5 weeks | Data Sci ×2, DevOps, BizOps | Looker licence |

Total: **24 weeks**, ~7 FTE average.

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Provider rate-limit outages | High | Medium | Gateway queue & fail-over providers |
| Cost over-run (GPU) | High | Medium | Budget guardrails, auto-scaling, spot instances |
| Data privacy / PII leakage | High | Low | Field-level encryption, DLP scanning |
| Model hallucinations | Med | High | Post-processing fact checker, user feedback loop |
| Regulatory changes (AI Act) | Med | Medium | Compliance review every release |

## 8. Expected ROI & Business Value

* **Revenue Uplift:** Premium “AI Pro” tier @ \$12 / seat / mo → \$2.1 M / yr.  
* **Retention:** 3-pt churn reduction = \$1.3 M savings.  
* **Productivity Gains:** 28 k saved staff-hours × \$30 blended rate = \$0.9 M value.  
* **Total Annual Impact:** **\$4.3 M** against \$480 k incremental cost → **9× ROI** in first year.
