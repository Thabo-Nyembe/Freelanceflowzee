## 2 Technical Implementation
### 2.1 Architecture
Client Dashboard ⇄ WS ⇄ Predictive Analytics API ⇢ Predictive Analytics System ⇢  
• TensorFlow.js models (IndexedDB persistence)  
• Redis-based metrics cache  
• Supabase for long-term metrics & results  
• AIGateway ↔ IntegratedAISystem / MultiModalAISystem / SmartCollabAI for live data  

### 2.2 Components
1. **Predictive Analytics System** – singleton service orchestrating ML pipelines, metric collection, optimization loops, circuit breakers.  
2. **ML Pipelines & Models** – dynamic training / online inference with scheduled re-training.  
3. **Auto-optimization Engine** – strategy registry, parameter tuner, rollback & confidence scoring.  
4. **Dashboard UI** – 5-tab React interface (Cost, Performance, Predictive, Optimization, Health).  
5. **API Layer** – REST endpoints for dashboard, anomaly queries, predictions, optimization triggers; WebSocket channel for push updates.
